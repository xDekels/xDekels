### 👋 Hey, I’m **Dekel** (@xDekels)
- 🎮 **Indie game developer** by passion, **Product Director** by day — I build games, build teams, build systems… basically if it can be shipped, I’ll ship it.
- 🔥 Deep into **Unity (C#)**, game design, and anything mixing tech + creativity. Also permanently distracted by cool gadgets and “what if I built this?” ideas.
- 📚 Constantly leveling up — usually juggling 1–2 courses on Udemy/Zenva covering coding, game dev, or whatever new rabbit hole I fell into this month.
- 🤝 Open to collaborations, especially with artists who love creating beautiful 2D/3D assets. If you like painting characters, environments, or UI art… let’s make magic.
- 🛠️ Currently building **DMG Forge**, my all-in-one indie-dev platform with tutorials, tools, and game assets, visit at https://dmgforge.com/
